# Conclusion

The Smart Headlight Intensity Control System successfully demonstrates how embedded systems and simple sensors can be used to improve road safety during night driving. By automatically adjusting headlight brightness based on ambient light conditions and the distance of oncoming vehicles, the system reduces glare and enhances visibility for both the driver and other road users.

The use of an ESP32 microcontroller, LDR sensor, and LiDAR sensor allows the system to operate efficiently with minimal hardware complexity. PWM-based control ensures smooth brightness transitions, avoiding sudden changes that could distract the driver. The system operates fully automatically and does not require any manual input once installed.

Overall, this project provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for intelligent vehicle lighting. It highlights the potential of sensor-based automation in automotive applications and serves as a strong foundation for future enhancements such as adaptive beam control, vehicle system integration, and AI-based decision making.
